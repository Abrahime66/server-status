# Server status page
![screenshot](https://status.trucksbook.eu/img/screenshot.png)

Very simple server status page written in PHP - target version 7, with some code changes it should be able to run almost anywhere. Can run even on shared webhosting without any problems and it was written exactly for that purpose. Because why waste your money on another server (or host on a server that you might want to do maintenance on), when you can use cheap webhosting?

## Translations
Any help with translations are much welcome! You can join us at https://poeditor.com/join/project/37SpmJtyOm. You can even add your own language. Just let me know when you're done and I'm going to include the language in the next release.

## FAQ

### Does it actually run somewhere?
Yes it does! This is basically debranded version of https://status.trucksbook.eu/. No demo of the admin page yet :)

### Why does this project exist?
It was written as a school project where we had to create a website. I went with this because I found the lack of good looking, easy to install and use status page rather weird. Therefore my goal (as stated above) was to create a simplistic status page that could run almost anywhere. The code is not the nicest or cleanest and it definitely doesn't have that many features, but hey, it works!

### How do I install this thing?
Simply put the files on your server and access it from your browser. There will be a simple install dialog waiting for you.

### What do I need to install this thing?
PHP & MYSQL should be enough :)

### I want feature XY!
You can write an issue and I will try to take a look when I get some time *OR* you can actually make a fork as the code it GNU licensed. Pull requests are most welcome!
